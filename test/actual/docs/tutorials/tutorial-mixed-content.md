### Mixed content: Markdown and HTML together

Consider the following scenario:

* Your page content and/or blog posts will be written in [markdown][markdown] format
* You want to embed Handlebars templates in your markdown content for certain types of metadata, such as links, date/time, etc.
* Your page [layouts][layouts] are made from HTML and Handlebars templates
* Your end goal is for all of your markdown content to be rendered to HTML in the output.

 and you want your need to compile some markdown files to HTML, and you want to use other markdown files as "includes" or "partials" inside other markdown files, in which case you want the markdown files to be rendered _as markdown_ in the output. You may even want to embed Handlebars templates inside your markdown files to be parsed and compiled.
