> Assemble is a dead-simple, "opinion aware", static site and component generator.

I've been trying to come up with a better slogan for Assemble for a while now, but I just can't think of anything that really gets across how powerful and easy it is to use.

Here is a short list of **the slogans that didn't make the cut**:

### Assemble: A blogging framework for slackers

That's right, _slackers_. Assemble can make you even more lazy, because it's just that easy to use. Although I love this fact (who doesn't like being lazy?), I'm not sure it tells the _entire_ story (btw, I tried "snackers" as well, but that makes absolutely no sense at all. So no).

If you haven't tried out assemble, give it a shot. Assemble can be used just for building Handlebars templates if that's all you need for a project.
Assemble was created to be a site builder, so it can do orders of magnitude more than Grunt tasks for building templates
