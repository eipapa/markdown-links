# Introduction

> Get familiarized with the basic building blocks of Assemble.

Assemble makes it easy to combine templates, content and data to produce any kind of resulting documents, including web pages, web components, blog posts, and so on.




## Getting started




## Building blocks

* Data
* Content
* Structure
* Behavior
* Styles


## Terminology

### Data

#### Configuration

#### Context


### Structure

#### Template


A [template](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Template) is a standardized non-executable file type used by computer software as a pre-formatted example on which to base other files, especially documents.

In other contexts, a template can be described as:

* a stencil, pattern or overlay used in graphic arts (drawing, painting, etc.) and sewing to replicate letters, shapes or designs
* a pre-developed page layout in electronic or paper media used to make new pages with a similar design, pattern, or style
* Form letter, a predefined letter which retains its primary intent when individually customised with variable data or text.


## Project Organization

#### Scaffold

A [scaffold](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scaffolding) is a temporary structure used to support people and material in the construction or repair of buildings and other large structures. It is usually a modular system of metal pipes or tubes, although it can be from other materials.

#### Boilerplate

> "Boiler plate" originally referred to the maker's label used to identify the builder of steam boilers.

* **Boilerplate code**, refers to sections of code that have to be included in many places with little or no alteration.
* **Boilerplate prototype**, a broadly working prototype that is constructed from cheaper or simpler materials. This was often applied to unarmoured tanks made of only soft steel, but it has also been applied to non-flyable engineering demonstrations of aircraft or spacecraft, built on simple steel frames rather than lightweight aerospace materials.
* **Boilerplate contract**, standard form contract between two parties that does not allow for negotiation
* **Boilerplate text**, any text that is or can be reused in new contexts or applications without being changed much from the original
