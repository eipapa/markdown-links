* **Configuration AND convention**. Assemble is highly extensible, so tinkerers and power users will find many ways to add new features or augment existing functionality. For those who prefer the ease-of-use of opinionated systems like Jekyll or Harp, [grab a boilerplate](#TODO) or run [one of our generators](#TODO) and let Yeoman do the work, so you can spend less time on figuring out how to organize the project.
* Not only can Assemble, ahem... well, assemble, but also minification, concatenation, cache-busting and post-processing. Beyond that, Assemble's core functionality is infinitely extensible via plugins and middleware.

## Handlebars Templates

Assemble's default template engine, Handlebars.js, uses a syntax characterized by double-curly-braces, `{{foo}}`, affectionately reffered to as mustaches. The most basic handlebars template is a simple identifier (Handlebars.js calls these "Handlebars expressions"):

```handlebars
<h1>{{title}}</h1>
```
To use this


Here are some of the highlights.

* Basic Variables: `{{title}}`
* Function expressions:
* Block expressions:
* Subexpressions:
* Partials:
