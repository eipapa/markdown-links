If you can work with HTML, you will be able to use Assemble! If this kind of templating is completely new to you, don't worry if it doesn't make sense right away. Give it time. Once it "clicks", a whole new world of possibilities in front end development will open up for you! Your code will become more modular and reusable, and your projects will become richer, more organized and easier to maintain.

We're always willing to help new users, so please stop out to [Assemble's GitHub Issues](https://github.com/assemble/assemble/issues) or ask a question on [StackOverflow](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/assemble) and someone from the core team or our super-supportive community will help you out!

## Getting Started

To get started with any new Assemble project, we recommend using the [Yeoman generator for Assemble](https://github.com/assemble/generator-assemble). Before continuing, be sure to have [Yeoman](http://yeoman.io/gettingstarted.html) installed globally, as well as [Bower](https://github.com/bower/bower) and [grunt-cli](https://github.com/gruntjs/grunt-cli), as Yeoman depends heavily on these both libs.

After you're setup with Yeoman you may install the Assemble generator with:

```bash
npm install -g generator-assemble
```

Next, create a new directory for your project, and in that directory run:

```bash
yo assemble
```
If all build success you're well on your way to successfully building your first Assemble project!
