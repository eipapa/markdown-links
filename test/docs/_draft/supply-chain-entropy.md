# Supply Chain Entropy, or "Why Order and Creativity Will Never Meet One Another".

> It is impossible for any process, no matter how idealized, to reduce the entropy of a system to its zero point value in a finite number of operations.

TODO:

* Describe assemble's position in the "supply chain"
* Explain why assemble causes negative entropy in the design-developement process
* Explain why reduced entropy in that system causes an increaes in "design entropy" - and why that's good.


## Closing Loops

Supply chains have lots of beginnings and lots of ends, and most of them will probably never meet one another. On one end of a supply chain you may have raw materials, and on the end of another supply chain you may have, say, an iPhone in the hands of an end-consumer. But supply chains which start with a raw material and finish with an end-consumer are exceedingly rare. These days, most supply chains in most industries are very specialized and highlighly decentralized. By the time a finished good reaches your hands, it may have passed through dozens of discrete and completely separate supply chains.

During the internet boom of the late 90s, the predominant belief was that as technology improved intermediaries would go away. The logic being that if one could make secure purchases online, there is no reason to believe that what works for consumers wouldn't also work for businesses. So as ecommerce methods and user experience improves, then intermediaries will slowly but surely dwindle away. Eventually to be forgotten as a relic and distant reminder of the post-industrial age. But, we were wrong.


## The Third Law of Thermodynamics

Enough time has passed for us to know that this notion of disintermediation was wrong. Not only was it wrong, it was embarrassingly wrong and on many fronts.   we know that intermediaries




What this means for modern manufacturers and intermediaries.
